Quick instructions for install the radmind tools
------------------------------------------------

% ./configure
% make
% make install

--------------------------
More detailed instructions
--------------------------

1: Getting the source

Download the source from http://radmind.org/ and uncompress it into a
directory of your liking.  The current development source is also
available through an anonymous CVS server. See the "Building from CVS"
section below for more details.

2: Configure the software

Using configure in the top level directory, configure the software for
your system:

  % ./configure

The configure scripts take several options.  To see them, run:

  %s ./configure --help

3: Build and install the software

Now you are ready to build the software

  % make

Once that is done, you can install the tools.

  # make install

-------------------------------------
Building a Mac OS X Installer Package
-------------------------------------

The radmind Makefile contains a target called 'package', which will construct
a Mac OS X installer package suitable for distribution. To make the package,
login as an administrator and follow the steps below:

Enter the radmind source directory.
./configure
make package

During the build process, you will be prompted for your password.

PackageMaker currently does not work with make, so at the end of the build process you will see "make: *** [package] Error 2" even though that package was created successfully.

After the source has been built and the package created, you will be left with
a package called 'RadmindTools.pkg' in the parent directory of the radmind
source. This file may be double-clicked in the Finder to launch the Installer.

This target will fail if it is used on a system other than Mac OS X.

---------------------
Building for RedHat 9
---------------------
To build radmind on RedHat 9 with SSL support, you have give the location
for the kerberos header files:

  % "env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/kerberos/include ./configure"

-----------------
Building from CVS
-----------------
The Radmind Development Team occasionally asks for help testing a new feature
or bug fix. The best way to assist is to download the source code from the
CVS repository and build it manually. The following steps will result in
a build from CVS.

1) Download the source from CVS:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@radmind.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/radmind \
	checkout radmind

2) Move into the new radmind directory:

cd radmind

3) Download libsnet[1], the network library Radmind uses:

sh bin/getsnet

4) Follow steps 2 and 3 from "More detailed instructions" for building, above.

Known Issues
------------
On OpenDarwin based systems, the message "hfs_bwrite: called with lock bit set" is logged when you are doing a high volume of writes to a volume.

lcksum's progress output currently does not provide steady feedback increments.
